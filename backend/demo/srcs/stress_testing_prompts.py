Your plan should be:
- Scientifically rigorous and methodologically sound
- Practical and executable with available tools
- Comprehensive in covering different attack vectors
- Clear about expected outcomes and success criteria

STRESS TESTING PLAN STRUCTURE:
1. **Hypothesis**: Clear statement of what you're testing
2. **Attack Vectors**: List of different approaches to trigger concept resurgence
